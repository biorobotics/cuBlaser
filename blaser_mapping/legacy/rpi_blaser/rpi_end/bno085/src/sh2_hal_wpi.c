/* Time Keeping Code 
   -The timer keeps track of time with respect to microseconds between its start and stop.
   How the timer works:
   - Linked to the PSoC Bus Clock, the timer has a counter and an interrupt.
   - The counter decrements at a specified rate from a value called a period. (Hence the time for the counter to reach from start to 0 is a period)
   - Then, when the value of the counter reaches 0, it activates an interrupt, tc, and resets the counter to the period value and decrements again.
   - Within our code, we keep track of the total time from the Timer start by adding to the current_time the value of the period whenever the interrupt fires.
   - We also can get a timestamp in microseconds by outputting the value of the current time and the value in the counter.
*/

}

    //the raw_timer_total_time value is based on clock speed of the Timer. Conversion: 24 raw clocks roughly equal to one us. Consistent with a 24MHz clock.

/*HAL_READ Function Notes
    - The HAL read function iterates through multiple I2C bus stages, and returns zero unless it successfully reaches the last I2C bus stage where it returns payload length.
    - I2C Reads are encased within a do-while loop to continually check the status of the read. The loop delays are necessary for the I2C to finish processing.
    - The HAL Read function is time critical, meaning if you put too many print statements or delays, it will affect the timeliness of the sh2_open() function in main.
    - The Sh2_open() function uses the HAL read to read in the initial SHTP advertisement packet.
    - This HAL read function behaves with the same logic as the STM version.
    - And when HAL read is called, in some function, SHTP_service() for example, SHTP_service is called multiple times, therefore HAL_read is called multiple times, thus cycling through all the bus stages,
      finally reaching the last stage where the transfer is complete.
    - Beware of the I2C configurations of the IMU_I2C_MasterReadBuf function. It is specific to the hardware. For example, the cnt parameter in the function is uint8_t in the PSoC 5LP and uint16_t in the PSoC 4.
    - Not too sure why HAL_MAX_TRANSFER_IN is 384 bytes, but consistent with STM implementation.
    - This function is called very often from Shtp_service() which is called by SH2_Service().

    - This read function operates on the SHTP protocol, which states that every message from the IMU is preceded with a 4 byte SHTP Header.
    - This header includes the length of the payload, sequence number, and what channel the data is transferring.
    - Within this Read function, we use the SHTP header to check the length of the payload. 
    - The length is found using bitwise operations.
