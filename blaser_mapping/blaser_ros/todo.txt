High-level:
1. VIO initialization scale issue: use laser stripe as constraints
2. Extrinsics parameter not so good.
3. Laser spline fitting and outlier removal.

Initialization:
1. Q: Can method 1 estimate rotation and translation accurately with little translation? We now do not care about feature depth estimation.
  todo:
  a) generate data through motion (large rotation, small translation) with non-co-planar 3d points (to see if homograph works)
  b) estimate fundamental matrix and essential matrix, see R t error

2. Q: can some depth help estimate R t in method 1?

3. why feature tracker publishes distorted uv?

Future list:
1. Better and smoother (spline?) laser stripe extraction. Apply bilateral filtering to each scan.
2. Use projective data association without KD-Tree
3. Try computing descriptor of same point across many frames, see if diff is big
6. FOL still not constrain other features' depths. Combine old method?
7. evaluation
8. remove laser pcd outliers

Todo:
x1. Build a map of laser and features
x2. Complete color estimation. 1pm
x3. Perform descriptor computation 12:30pm
x4. Feed points into map after marginalization, incrementally compute normal. 
x4.T visualize map points, including color 3pm
5. Functions yielding matches, for laser pt + norm, for feature pt.
5.T visualize matches, no residuals yet 4pm
6. Ceres residuals
6.T visualize map points w/ and w/o?
7. Merge map points
7.T visualize the process of merging
1. try old fashioned way, restore old feature, add 3D laser constraint
2. if no work, inspect reasons for FoL rejection, classify feature type: F_ON_L, F_NEAR_l, F_NO_L. Treat in individual ways.
12. test & debug feature association

Actions:
2. logic: for F_ON_L no depth, for F_NEAR_L use depth of laser frame, for F_NO_L use depth of first frame.
3. Q: how to find laser frame? visual frame is first frame. laser_start_frame - start_frame?
